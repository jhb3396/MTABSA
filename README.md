# Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis via Multitask Learning for Online Reviews
This repo contains the PyTorch implementaion for the paper [Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis via Multitask Learning for Online Reviews].

## Requirements
* Python 3.7.13
* PyTorch 1.11.0
* Transformers 4.1.1


## Preprocess
The preprocess codes are in `data_preprocess_semeval.py` and `data_preprocess_twitter.py`. However we already provided the preprocessed datasets with dependency parcing results in `./data/`, so you can skip preprocess.

## Training
Run:
`./run.sh`
